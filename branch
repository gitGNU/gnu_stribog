exp.2008.apr.bootloader<trunc<autobuild

experimental branch
main tasks are:

write a bootloader for LPC213x RAM-based programs.
try to catch the alignment-like bug.

we don't like the built-in one because 
(a) it does not permit to load a congiguous program:
 we need to load interrupt vectors and the program body
 into separate regions;
(b) it is not very fast

our bootloader resides in upper 1k RAM; it loads binary
rather than uuencoded data so it should be faster.
