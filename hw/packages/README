This directory contains gEDA footprints for the hardware part of stribog.
stribog boards were constructed using them but do not otherwise depend
on them.

These files (except this README file) are NOT part of the stribog design,
but are used with stribog. they form an `external library'
as defined by the FSF.

This file is part of stribog.

As a special exception, you may use gschem symbols derived from
external sources (e.g. geda symbols) that are distributed under
the GNU GPL version 2 when they are not originally distributed under
the GNU GPLv3-compatible license. these symbols must be distributed
with other source files of the project and considered an external
library or augmentation of geda-symbols package. they can't be embedded
in any stribog file.

The following non-text source in this directory possibly
contain no copyright notices, 
because it was practically hard or absurd to maintain them there,
or they can go unnoticed there, and stribog's author
decided to move/duplicate those notices here, namely:

0.125W_resistor
0603
0805
1210
2.5mm_10pin_header
adxl210
crystal
hmc1021z
jtag1.27x1
led0805
lp2980
msop8

These files should also have additional copyrights
from their original and intermediate authors. it is hard to figure out
exact list of authors, because the earliest history of the derivations
was lost. however, we can tell we are not original authors
and the files are distributed under "GPL v2 or later";
therefore, we distribute the files should under the terms
of 'the GNU GPL v$(OUR_CURRENT_GPL_VERSION) or later'.

Once more, MOST of the PCB FOOTPRINTS WERE NOT originally
DEVELOPPED by STRIBOG'S AUTHOR:
usually we just slightly corrected files from PCB libraries.
the STRIBOG AUTHORS DISCLAIM our EXCLUSIVE COPYRIGHT on ALL those files.
as a sequence, THEY CAN BE DISTRIBUTED under the TERMS of
'GPL v$(OUR_CURRENT_GPL_VERSION) or later' ONLY.
