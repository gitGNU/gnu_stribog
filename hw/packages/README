The following non-text source in this directory possibly
contain no copyright notices, 
because it was practically hard or absurd to maintain them there,
or they can go unnoticed there, and stribog's author
decided to move/duplicate those notices here, namely:

0.125W_resistor
0603
0805
1210
2.5mm_10pin_header

These files should also have additional copyrights
from their original and intermediate authors. it is very hard to figure out
exact list of authors, because there is neither copyright notice in the files
theirselves nor especially maintained lists of files with respective authors.
all we could tell we are not original authors and the files are distributed
under "GPL v2 or later". for using these files in your packages see discussions
in the gEDA lists. stribog's authors' position is similar to the gEDA developers' 
one, namely, "the symbols/packages contain 'derived work' therefore are to be 
distributed under 'GPL v$(OUR_CURRENT_GPL_VERSION) or later', however 
the schematics/boards files containing those symbols contain no such work and 
the symbols/packages impose no such restriction on them". 

Once more, MOST of the gEDA SYMBOLS (in hw/sym) and PCB FOOTPRINTS 
(in hw/packages) WERE NOT originally DEVELOPPED by STRIBOG'S AUTHOR: 
usually we just slightly corrected files from gEDA and PCB libraries.
the AUTHORS DISCLAIM our EXCLUSIVE COPYRIGHT on ALL those files.
as a sequence, THEY CAN BE DISTRIBUTED under the TERMS of
'GPL v$(OUR_CURRENT_GPL_VERSION) or later' ONLY.
