The following non-text source in this directory possibly
contain no copyright notices, 
because it was practically hard or absurd to maintain them there,
or they can go unnoticed there, and stribog's author
decided to move/duplicate those notices here, namely:

main_board.pcb main_board.bis.pcb stribog.sch gyro.sch odo.sch

Directories `schematics', `main_board' and `main_board.bis'
contain object code only
(automatically generated files for boards production). they are
kept with sources for those who has no gEDA installed.

Makefile.in is autoconf-generated (see ../README for details).

See also README files in the subdirectories. particularly,
files in `sym' and `packages' directories are `external libraries'
and not parts of stribog.
