The following non-text source in this directory possibly
contain no copyright notices, 
because it was practically hard or absurd to maintain them there,
or they can go unnoticed there, and stribog's author
decided to move/duplicate those notices here, namely:

ATmega8-1.sym
JTAG.sym
adm202.sym
adxl210.sym
adxrs300.sym
bat54c.sym
dac7612.sym
hmc1021.sym
hmc1022.sym
ina118.sym
irf7317.sym
irf7507.sym
irlml.sym
led.sym
lm74.sym
lp2980AIM5-3.sym
lp2980AIM5-5.sym
lpc2138.sym
ref195.sym
tps76316.sym

These files should also have additional copyrights
from their original and intermediate authors. it is very hard to figure out
exact list of authors, because there is neither copyright notice in the files
theirselves nor especially maintained lists of files with respective authors.
all we could tell we are not original authors and the files are distributed
under "GPL v2 or later". for using these files in your packages see discussions
in the gEDA lists. stribog's authors' position is similar to the gEDA developers' 
one, namely, "the symbols/packages contain 'derived work' therefore are to be 
distributed under 'GPL v$(OUR_CURRENT_GPL_VERSION) or later', however 
the schematics/boards files containing those symbols contain no such work and 
the symbols/packages impose no such restriction on them". 

Once more, MOST of the gEDA SYMBOLS (in hw/sym) and PCB FOOTPRINTS 
(in hw/packages) WERE NOT originally DEVELOPPED by STRIBOG'S AUTHOR: 
usually we just slightly corrected files from gEDA and PCB libraries.
the AUTHORS DISCLAIM our EXCLUSIVE COPYRIGHT on ALL those files.
as a sequence, THEY CAN BE DISTRIBUTED under the TERMS of
'GPL v$(OUR_CURRENT_GPL_VERSION) or later' ONLY.
