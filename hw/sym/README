This directory contains gEDA symbols for the hardware part of stribog.
stribog schematics were constructed using them but do not otherwise depend
on them.

These files (except this README file) are NOT part of the stribog design,
but are used with stribog. they form an `external library'
as defined by the FSF.

This file is part of stribog.

As a special exception, you may use gschem symbols derived from
external sources (e.g. geda symbols) that are distributed under
the GNU GPL version 2 when they are not originally distributed under
the GNU GPLv3-compatible license. these symbols must be distributed
with other source files of the project and considered an external
library or augmentation of geda-symbols package. they can't be embedded
in any stribog file.

The following non-text source in this directory possibly
contain no copyright notices, 
because it was practically hard or absurd to maintain them there,
or they can go unnoticed there, and stribog's author
decided to move/duplicate those notices here, namely:

ATmega8-1.sym
JTAG.sym
adm202.sym
adxl210.sym
adxrs300.sym
bat54c.sym
dac7612.sym
hmc1021.sym
hmc1022.sym
ina118.sym
irf7317.sym
irf7507.sym
irlml.sym
led.sym
lm74.sym
lp2980AIM5-3.sym
lp2980AIM5-5.sym
lpc2138.sym
ref195.sym
tps76316.sym

These files should also have additional copyrights
from their original and intermediate authors. it is hard to figure out
exact list of authors, because the earliest history of the derivations
was lost. however, we can tell we are not original authors
and the files are distributed under "the GPLv2";
an exception was provided in order to use them.

Once more, MOST of the gEDA SYMBOLS WERE NOT originally
DEVELOPPED by STRIBOG'S AUTHOR:
usually we just slightly corrected files from gEDA libraries.
the STRIBOG AUTHORS DISCLAIM our EXCLUSIVE COPYRIGHT on ALL those files.
