These files are NOT part of the stribog design,
but are used with stribog. they form an `external library'
as defined by the FSF.

They will become a part of stribog if we get savannah
administration permission to add the GNU FDL to the project licenses.

(0a) This directory contains the project documentation, namely
stribog.texinfo and it's opaque form stribog.info. the files are
copyrighted by Ineiev and GNU FDL-covered. the rest is distributed
as follows:

(0) This file, ./README, ./ChangeLog, ./NEWS and Autotools input files
(./configure.ac, ./Makefile.am) are copyrighted by Ineiev
and covered with the GNU GPLv3+.

(3) Autotools-related files are distributed
under respective licenses, namely
./Makefile.in AT_permissive => GPLv3+ (object code)
./aclocal.m4 AT_permissive => GPLv3+ (object code)
./configure C_unlimited => GPLv3+

AT_permissive means

gives unlimited permission to copy and/or distribute it,
with or without modifications, as long as this notice is preserved.

AT_permissive => GPLv3+ means "has AT_unlimited copyright note,
rendered under the GPLv3+ due to being an object form of some code
distributed under the GPLv3+".

(3a) Some of these files copyrighted by the FSF are parts 
of Autotools distributed under respective licenses, namely
./INSTALL I_unlimited -> GPLv3+

I_unlimited -> GPLv3+ means "come under the I_unlimited terms,
redistributed under the GPLv3+".

(3c) ./texinfo.tex is copyrighted by the FSF and distributed under
the GNU GPLv3+.

(5) The texts of the GNU licenses, ./fdl.texi and ./gpl-3.0.texi,
are copyrighted by the FSF as stated in these files.
(``Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.'')
./COPYING is a plain text version of ./gpl-3.0.texi.

These files are not copyrighted by the stribog authors: some are
not at all, other only partially. we let our copyright notes
come into these files like 'configure', and 'Makefile.in',
but one should undestand that they are result of
compilation of several sources and such a file can hardly represent
a single copyrighted unit. the files come to the project under
permissive terms compatible with the GPLv3+. stribog authors
redistribute them under the terms of the GPLv3+.

(6) The file ./AUTHORS has a special status.
it essentially consists of copyright notices.
as such, these notices can't be removed; the project maintainers
are encouraged to keep the notices up-to-date.

Here is the full files list
./aclocal.m4      (3) GPLv3+ (object code)
./AUTHORS         (6) copyright notes: open for necessary additions
./ChangeLog       (0) GPLv3+
./configure       (3) GPLv3+ (object code)
./configure.ac    (0) GPLv3+
./COPYING         (5) license terms: distributable verbatim
./fdl.texi        (5) license terms: distributable verbatim
./gpl-3.0.texi    (5) license terms: distributable verbatim
./INSTALL         (3a) GPLv3+
