 make sources look like a decent distribution:

 (1) clean up copyright notices. take as a good example Emacs sources
 (2) wait for 17 days for FSF answer on cross-compilers; decide on
     these dependencies inclusion
 (3) prepare documentation:
     a. basically learn texinfo
     b. enrich the maintainer's memory with knowledge of the FDL
     c. get from savannah administration permission to change
        the set of the licenses (add the FDL)
