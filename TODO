06 Aug 2014 test

02 Mar 2008 [03 Mar 2008 start]
 [02 Apr firstly complete: compare with the GNU standards 
  and think once more
 ]
 [24 Apr 2008 experimental branches naming conventions]
work out a distinct conception on branches and revision
naming conventions
31 Mar 2008 [02 Apr frozen: it is questionable in what form
 the distribution may come]
 [24 Apr 2008 (thanks a million to Sylvain Beucler)
  the toolchains requirement applies for
  object form distributions; source code distributing
  does not require them.
 ]
 [03 May 2008 complete:
  GPLv3 has a clause that free and widely
  available tools are not necessary to be included into
  the distribution
 ]
find a host and an archive form where we could put stribog
sources together with tools needed (binutils, gcc, gEDA)
to make a GPL-compiant distribution
