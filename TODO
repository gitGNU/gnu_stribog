23 Arp 2008 [23 Apr start]
 write new bootloader; look if the alignment-like bug disappear

09 Feb 2008 [17 Feb 2008 complete] 
 migrate to git
09 Feb 2008 [19Feb2008 start] [12 Apr 2008 hw/ schematics only remain]
 invoke GNU autobuild tools
 [25 Mar 2008]
 migrate to autoconf-2.62 when it is released. [10 Apr 2008 done]
 it should support [12 Apr 2008 both the next work]
  (1) --help=recursive
  (2) recursive 'configure' calls
18 Feb 2008 [25 Feb 2008 complete]
 make sw/target programs work from the flash
18 Feb 2008
 implement on-board attitude computation
 [04 Apr 2008]
 this probably will start when GCC supports fixed-point math on ARMs
02 Apr 2008 [02 Apr 2008 start]
 [02 Apr 2008 should we claim sym/footprints to be an external library?]
 make sources look like a decent distribution:

 (1) clean up copyright notices. take as a good example Emacs sources
 [12 Apr 2008 basically done. 
  AUTHORS file status to be cleared; THANKS to be added]
 (2) wait for 17 days for FSF answer on cross-compilers; decide on
     these dependencies inclusion
     [14 Apr 2008 no answer yet. preliminary decision is to pack several
      tars with READMEs explaining what is needed in a compliant
      distribution]
 (3) prepare documentation:
     a. basically learn texinfo 
        [08 Apr 2008 at the moment texinfo does not support
         non-Latin characters. LaTeX is much better in this.
         the documentation system is to be selected.]
	[LaTeX is not very good for non-printed documentation.
	 the project currently can live without non-latin letters.
	 Texinfo has two Russian-speaking maintainers.
	 the i18n will probably be supported]
     b. enrich the maintainer's memory with knowledge of the FDL 
	    [before 08 Apr 2008 first pass done]
		[15 Apr 2008 second pass done]
     c. get from savannah administration permission to change
        the set of the licenses (add the FDL)
 1. of course, finish mounting the project on Autotools 
14 Apr 2008
 sw/auxilia: provide a script for convenient writing the installed
  in ${prefix} programs into target AVRs.
