 invoke GNU autobuild tools
 [25 Mar 2008]
 migrate to autoconf-2.62 when it is released. [10 Apr 2008 done]
 it should support
  (1) --help=recursive [10 Apr 2008 still doesn't work]
  (2) recursive 'configure' calls

 implement on-board attitude computation

02 Apr 2008 [02 Apr 2008 start]
 [02 Apr 2008 should we claim sym/footprints to be an external library?]
 make sources look like a decent distribution:

 (1) clean up copyright notices. take as a good example Emacs sources
 (2) wait for 17 days for FSF answer on cross-compilers; decide on
     these dependencies inclusion
 (3) prepare documentation:
     a. basically learn texinfo 
	    [08 Apr 2008 at the moment texinfo does not support
         non-Latin characters. LaTeX is much better in this.
         the documentation system is to be selected.
		]
     b. enrich the maintainer's memory with knowledge of the FDL 
	    [before 08 Apr 2008 first pass done]
     c. get from savannah administration permission to change
        the set of the licenses (add the FDL)
 1. of course, finish mounting the project on Autotools
