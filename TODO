 implement on-board attitude computation
 [04 Apr 2008]
 this probably will start when GCC supports fixed-point math on ARMs
02 Apr 2008 [02 Apr 2008 start]
 [02 Apr 2008 should we claim sym/footprints to be an external library?
  [21 May 2008 done. nice idea]
 ]
 make sources look like a decent distribution:

 (1) clean up copyright notices. take as a good example Emacs sources
 [12 Apr 2008 basically done. 
  AUTHORS file status to be cleared; THANKS to be added
 ]
 [06 May 2008 AUTHORS status clarified]
 [30 Jul 2008 THANKS is present; more thorough revision in progress]
 (2) wait for 17 days for FSF answer on cross-compilers; decide on
     these dependencies inclusion
     [14 Apr 2008 no answer yet. preliminary decision is to pack several
      tars with READMEs explaining what is needed in a compliant
      distribution]
      [05 May 2008 
       first, the compiler is required for binary distributions only;
       second, GPLv3 has an exception clause for free tools
      ]
 (3) prepare documentation:
     a. basically learn texinfo [30 Jul 2008 done]
        [08 Apr 2008 at the moment texinfo does not support
         non-Latin characters. LaTeX is much better in this.
         the documentation system is to be selected.]
	[LaTeX is not very good for non-printed documentation.
	 the project currently can live without non-Latin letters.
	 Texinfo has two Russian-speaking maintainers.
	 the i18n will probably be supported]
     b. enrich the maintainer's memory with knowledge of the FDL 
            [before 08 Apr 2008 first pass done]
            [15 Apr 2008 second pass done]
            [06 May 2008 third pass done; 
             enough to proceed to the next item]
     c. get from savannah administration permission to change
        the set of the licenses (add the FDL)
        [16 Jun 2008 request sent]
	[30 Jul 2008 the documentation is scheduled to become an external project]
     d. actually write the documentation
	    [17 Jun 2008 start] [06 Oct 2008 initially done]
 1. of course, finish mounting the project on Autotools [29 May 2008 done]
14 Apr 2008
 sw/auxilia: provide a script for convenient writing the installed
  in ${prefix} programs into target AVRs.
17 Jun 2008
 sw/target: make the programs event-driven
 hw: add switches to enable power-saving modes
