In theory, the implications of this can depend on your jurisdiction.
three groups of cases are possible.

1. Your government either
a)does not honour copyright and Bern Convention,
 or
b) the law practice of your country does not consider technical articles
like software and hardware descriptions as a pieces of art.

Then you are lucky and GPL is not written about you. beware
that this is the most impossible case, in spite of that
it is the most reasonable one.

2. Both programs and hardware are considered as works of art
and printed circuit boards are treated as derived from the design description
works. then the conditions are like following.

All that comes from the project forms a derived work, including the assembled
boards. they should be distributed in a the GPL-compliant way as "Object Code".
essentially this means that if someone ships a stribog-derived board, 
this person or organisation must make available (for those who get
the product) a copy of documentation needed at least to reproduce this board;
this supplier shall not prevent downstream distribution in terms other
than that of the GPL. another thing to note is the Section 11 of the GNU GPL
(on patents). while there should be no software patents, the hardware ones
are ubiquitous. currently stribog concerned with no patents, but this
may change some day.

As a consequence using stribog-derived circuits in a device is permitted 
in either of two ways:
a) the whole device is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL 
 (with the stribog's authors' interpretation for the hardware part).
 this is the preferable way.
b) the device can reasonably be considered as an independent work. for
example, connecting a board to stribog main board via connectors
that provide power, UART signals and angular rate sensors output does not
make the former board stribog-derived, because there is nothing very
specific in those signals and the boards are distinct;
but if some stribog circuits are incorporated into another board, 
there is no more separable independent work, so that board 
must be covered by the GPL. similarly, if you modify stribog so that
it will require/provide complicated signals from/to your board, therefore
making it unimaginable to function one without the other -- in this
case the whole system shall be covered by the GNU GPL.

3. Printed boards are not considered to be a derived work. this is
probably the most frequent case (at least, this applies to the USA).

You may produce the boards and do all you want with them. you are not
obliged (though encouraged) to give the design files when you provide
the board instances.

Please note that the intention of these provisions is not to prepend you
to use the project, but to create conditions leading to the society
without copyright on technical information.

The software part is released right under the terms of the GNU GPL v3 with
all new statements on 'Installation Information'; there is few ambiguities.

The following non-text source files possibly contain no copyright notices, 
because stribog's author decided to move those notices here for convenience, 
namely:

To all these files is applied the copyright and license notice placed earlier
in this file. hw/sym/* and hw/packages should have also additional copyrights 
from their original and intermediate authors. it is hard to figure out
exact list of authors, because the earliest history of derivations was lost.
however, we can tell we are not original authors and the files are distributed
under "the GPLv2" (the symbols) or "the GPLv2 or later" (the footprints).

Once more, MOST of the gEDA SYMBOLS (in hw/sym) and PCB FOOTPRINTS 
(in hw/packages) WERE NOT originally DEVELOPPED by STRIBOG'S AUTHOR: 
usually we just slightly corrected files from gEDA and PCB libraries.
the AUTHORS DISCLAIM our EXCLUSIVE COPYRIGHT on ALL those files.
as a sequence, THEY CAN BE DISTRIBUTED under the TERMS of
'the GPLv2' (the symbols) and 'the GPLv3 or later' (the footprints) ONLY.
