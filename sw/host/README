Stribog-hosttools provide utilities used outside
the stribog hardware. to build them it is typically
enough to have a POSIX evironment installed.
these programs include:

elk/elk: LPC213x bootloader host-side part. after
the loaded program is run elk also sends preferences to it.

conloq/conloq: data logger used to save stribog observations
on the host filesystem. it is assummed that multa.elf
is running on the stribog main board.

conloq/expon: a program to translate binary files saved
with conloq/conloq into text messages for subsequent processing.

conloq/magex-conloq: the same as conloq for magex.elf running
on the board.

conloq/magexp: expon for files written with magex-conloq.

conloq/parse_tsipex: host-side test for stribog UART protocol.

conloq/caed: splits files saved with conloq on pieces at
given board times.

intlpc/intlpc: writes LPC213x program checksum into certain
interrupt vector to make it possible to run the program from
the flash.

postproc/exvel: ad-hoc mechanisation.

postproc/process: a script running exvel and sorting it's output
to draw the results with gnuplot.

utils/50hz 50Hz synchronous detector for magnetic data

utils/drift: estimates temperature drifts of gains and biases
of the sensors

utils/fdif: outputs difference between two curves

utils/lpfilter: trivial per-column low-pass filter

utils/stat: per-column mean and rms estimation
----------------------------------
How to (re)mount the GNU build system (as of Feb 2008)
using Autoconf 2.61 and Automake 1.10
(both Autoconf 2.13 and 2.59 don't work; for this reason
 all autogenerated files up to `configure' will be pushed
 into the repository
)

To regenerate configure scripts cd into sw/host/ and run
$ autoreconf

autom4te.cache/ can be optionally 'rm -fr'ed

configure.ac was initially made by
$ autoscan; sed -s -e "/AC_CHECK_LIB([[]m[]]/s/main/sqrt/"<configure.scan|\
 sed -e "/\# FIXME: Replace .main. with a function in .-lm.:/s/^.*$//"|\
 sed -e "/AC_INIT/s/^.*$/AC_INIT([stribog-hosttools], [0.0.0-rc0], \
  [ineiev@users.sourceforge.net])\nAM_INIT_AUTOMAKE/" \
 >configure.ac; rm configure.scan autoscan.log

(repeat twice if needed)

This file won't be regenerated; new clauses
will appear when comparing with autoscan results
and other considerations.

The rest files are generated by
$ autoreconf -i

the generated/installed files are
INSTALL
autom4te.cache/*
install-sh
depcomp
Makefile.in
conloq/Makefile.in
elk/Makefile.in
intlpc/Makefile.in
postproc/Makefile.in
utils/Makefile.in
aclocal.m4
config.h.in
configure.ac
missing
config.guess
config.sub

The usual developer procedure of regeneration is to invoke
autoscan and autoreconf in no certain sequence,
looking at the results and editing the files on need.
