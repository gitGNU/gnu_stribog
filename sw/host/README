Stribog-hosttools provide utilities used outside
the stribog hardware. to build them it is typically
enough to have a POSIX evironment installed.
these programs include:

elk/elk: LPC213x bootloader host-side part. after
the loaded program is run elk also sends preferences to it.

conloq/conloq: data logger used to save stribog observations
on the host filesystem. it is assummed that multa.elf
is running on the stribog main board.

conloq/expon: a program to translate binary files saved
with conloq/conloq into text messages for subsequent processing.

conloq/magex-conloq: the same as conloq for magex.elf running
on the board.

conloq/magexp: expon for files written with magex-conloq.

conloq/parse_tsipex: host-side test for stribog UART protocol.

conloq/caed: splits files saved with conloq on pieces at
given board times.

intlpc/intlpc: writes LPC213x program checksum into certain
interrupt vector to make it possible to run the program from
the flash.

postproc/exvel: ad-hoc mechanisation.

postproc/process: a script running exvel and sorting it's output
to draw the results with gnuplot.

utils/50hz 50Hz synchronous detector for magnetic data

utils/drift: estimates temperature drifts of gains and biases
of the sensors

utils/fdif: outputs difference between two curves

utils/lpfilter: trivial per-column low-pass filter

utils/stat: per-column mean and rms estimation

How to build (as of Mar 2008)

Stribog host tools use GNU-standard configuration procedure
(see INSTALL). Though general build versus source directory
positions should work, the usual way is to build the project 
in a separate directory out of the source tree, so
the configure invocation sounds like this:

../stribog/sw/host/configure --prefix=$HOME/stribog
----------------------------------
How to (re)mount the GNU build system (as of Mar 2008)
using Autoconf 2.61 and Automake 1.10
(both Autoconf 2.13 and 2.59 don't work; for this reason
 all autogenerated files up to `configure' will be pushed
 into the repository
)

To regenerate configure scripts cd into sw/host/ and run
$ autoreconf

autom4te.cache/ can be optionally 'rm -fr'ed

configure.ac was initially made by
$ autoscan; sed -s -e "/AC_CHECK_LIB([[]m[]]/s/main/sqrt/"<configure.scan|\
 sed -e "/\# FIXME: Replace .main. with a function in .-lm.:/s/^.*$//"|\
 sed -e "/AC_INIT/s/^.*$/AC_INIT([stribog-hosttools], [0.0.0-rc0], \
  [ineiev@users.sourceforge.net])\nAM_INIT_AUTOMAKE/" \
 >configure.ac; rm configure.scan autoscan.log

(repeat twice if needed)

This file won't be regenerated; new clauses
will appear when comparing with autoscan results
and other considerations.

The rest files are generated by
$ autoreconf -i

the generated/installed files are
INSTALL
autom4te.cache/*
install-sh
depcomp
Makefile.in
conloq.src/Makefile.in
elk.src/Makefile.in
intlpc/Makefile.in
postproc/Makefile.in
tests/Makefile.in
utils/Makefile.in
aclocal.m4
compile
config.h.in
configure.ac
missing
config.guess
config.sub

The usual developer procedure of regeneration is to invoke
autoscan and autoreconf in no certain sequence,
looking at the results and editing the files on need.

After the regeneration itself it is recommended to build the package
to ensure that user make procedure will not trigger autoreconf.
