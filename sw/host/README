Stribog-hosttools provide utilities used outside
the stribog hardware. to build them it is typically
enough to have a POSIX evironment installed.
these programs include:

elk: LPC213x bootloader host-side part. after
the loaded program is run elk also sends preferences to it.

conloq: data logger used to save stribog observations
on the host filesystem. it is assummed that multa.elf
is running on the stribog main board.

expon: a program to translate binary files saved
with conloq/conloq into text messages for subsequent processing.

magex-conloq: the same as conloq for magex.elf running
on the board.

magexp: expon for files written with magex-conloq.

parse_tsipex: host-side test for stribog UART protocol.

caed: splits files saved with conloq on pieces at
given board times.

postproc/exvel: ad-hoc mechanisation.

postproc/process: a script running exvel and sorting it's output
to draw the results with gnuplot.

50hz: 50Hz synchronous detector for magnetic data

drift: estimates temperature drifts of gains and biases
of the sensors

fdif: outputs difference between two curves

lpfilter: trivial per-column low-pass filter

stat: per-column mean and rms estimation

How to build (as of Jun 2008)

Stribog host tools use GNU-standard configuration procedure
(see INSTALL). Though general build versus source directory
positions should work, the usual way is to build the project 
in a separate directory out of the source tree, so
the configure invocation sounds like this:

../stribog/sw/host/configure

How to (re)mount the GNU build system

See ../../README

Autotools-related files, namely
INSTALL
Makefile.in
aclocal.m4
autom4te.cache/* (manually deleted after regeneration)
compile
config.h.in
config.guess
configure
config.sub
depcomp
install-sh
missing
postproc/Makefile.in
utils/Makefile.in

These files are not copyrighted by the stribog authors: some are
not at all, other only partially.
we let our copyright notes come into these files like 'configure',
and 'Makefile.in', but one should undestand that they are result of
compilation of several sources and such a file can hardly represent
a single copyrighted unit.

The usual developer procedure of regeneration is to invoke
autoscan and autoreconf in no certain sequence,
looking at the results and editing the files on need.

After the regeneration itself it is recommended to build the package
to ensure that user make procedure will not trigger autoreconf.
