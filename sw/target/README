the GNU GPLv3-compatible license. these symbols must be distributed
with other source files of the project and considered an external

Note: Autotools-related files, namely

are not exclusively copyrighted by the stribog authors: some are
not at all, other only partially.
we let our copyright notes come into these files like 'configure',
and 'Makefile.in', but one should undestand that they are result of
compilation of several sources and such a file can hardly represent
a single copyrighted unit.
