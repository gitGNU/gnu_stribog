a week ago stribog had a field test. the next corrections followed:
 target software: magnetic sampling frequency adjusted to 16*50 Hz;
  magex: raw 800 Hz output (without chechsums) added
  uart0.c: more reasonable input function
  multa.c: measurements output rate changed to 200 Hz
 host software: a parser for magex output written
  conloq: GPS parser (initially) added
 main board: x and y axes drawn.

31 Mar 06
 target software: UART0 functions written; accelerometer channels
  sequence changed to conform with the magnetic sensors. 
 host software: limited Win32 support added

22 Mar 06
 all on-board sensors do work. magnetic sensors bandwidth should be
 defined more precisely and increased.
 mag_response program added: it is to measure DAC response to magnetic
 sensors output. the measured values define kx, ky and kz in mag.c
C35 is tantalum again.

18 Mar 06
fixed a bug in the hardware part: pins 2 and 4 of Q2 must be swapped
 resistance R33 decreased to 30 Ohm.
 initially added a software module for magnetic sensors

04 Mar 06 
added pullup resistor to RESET
R17..R20 changed to 2.2k, R21..R24 --- to 3.3k

24 Feb 06
 LEDs added
 Tantalum capacitor C35 replaced with ceramic 0805
